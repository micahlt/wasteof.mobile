## Development

### Setup

First, clone the repository, switch to the correct branch, and install your dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micahlt/wasteof.mobile
cd wasteof.mobile
npm install
```

Next, set up your Android environment. There's some great documentation on this by the React Native team [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). You can also use a Docker container like https://github.com/mreichelt/docker-android that has good presets for Android development.

### Connect a device or emulator

Connect your Android phone over [USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) or [wireless debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#connect-to-a-device-over-wi-fi-android-11+). If you don't have a device you can use, you can [set up an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) in Android Studio.

### Run

```bash
npm run android
```

This will create an instance of Metro, the JavaScript bundler, and also start a Gradle process to build and install the app. Ensure that Metro remains running or you won't be able to hot-reload your app.
