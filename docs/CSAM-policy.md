# ðŸ“œ wasteof for Android CSAM Policy


>Last updated: July 2025

wasteof for Android is a third-party client application that connects to [wasteof.mobile](https://wasteof.mobile), a social platform that hosts user-generated content. We do not host or control any content directly, but we are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our users and complying with Google Play's policies and global standards for online safety.

## Zero Tolerance Policy

We have a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) or any sexually exploitative content involving minors.

If any CSAM is discovered in content rendered by the app, we will:

- Immediately disable access to the content within the app (if possible).
- Report the material to wasteof.money for moderation or removal.
- Report the material to relevant authorities, such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), if required.

## Reporting Mechanism

If you encounter any content in wasteof for Android that appears to include CSAM or violates this policy, please report it using one of the following methods:

- The report button, if available next to the content.
- Email the moderators of wasteof.money at [jefflo at wasteof dot money] with a link or description of the content.
- You can also report content directly to wasteof.money using their official website.

We will respond to all CSAM-related reports as a priority.

## Our Role

While wasteof for Android does not moderate content on wasteof.money, we actively:

- Forward abuse reports to wasteof.money moderators.
- Work to prevent the display of known or reported CSAM in-app.
- Cooperate with platform moderation systems when applicable.

We regularly review our safety practices and will disable app access to content or features if necessary to maintain user safety and legal compliance.

## Additional Notes

**CSAM is illegal and morally reprehensible.  If you are aware of a situation involving a child at risk, contact your local law enforcement immediately.**
